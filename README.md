# Memory-Efficient-Audio-Melspectrogram-Tranformer-Model

This repository contains the implementation for Memory Efficient Audio Melspectrogram Tranformer Model (MEAMTM) which utilizes nnAudio and the Audio Spectrogram Transformer to offer a memory-efficient solution for audio classification. With this model, you can directly feed audio waveforms without the need to convert them into spectrograms separately, saving both storage and memory.

# Features
* Memory Efficiency: The model eliminates the need for intermediate spectrogram conversion, reducing memory requirements and improving efficiency.
* Ease of Use: Simplified audio processing pipeline by directly handling audio waveforms.
* nnAudio Integration: Utilizes the nnAudio library for efficient audio processing and feature extraction
* Audio Spectrogram Transformer: Leverages the capabilities of the Audio Spectrogram Transformer for effective feature extraction from audio spectrograms/Melspectrograms.
